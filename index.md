Welcome to the homepage for the ECS [COMP6237 Data Mining](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6237) module.

The challenge of data mining is to transform raw data into useful information and actionable knowledge. Data mining is the computational process of discovering patterns in data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and data management. 

This course will introduce key concepts in data mining, information extraction and information indexing; including specific algorithms and techniques for feature extraction, clustering, outlier detection, topic modelling and prediction of complex unstructured data sets. By taking this course you will be given a broad view of the general issues surrounding unstructured and semi-structured data and the application of algorithms to such data. At a practical level you will have the chance to explore an assortment of data mining techniques which you will apply to problems involving real-world data. 

## Lectures
The lectures for this course will be given by <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/mb8">Dr Markus Brede</a> ([email](mailto:mb8@ecs.soton.ac.uk)), <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jh1c18">Dr Jo Grundy</a> ([email](mailto:j.grundy@soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/se3e22">Dr Shoaib Ehsan</a>  ([email](mailto:s.ehsan@soton.ac.uk))

The lecture slots are as follows: 

Day        | Time | Room   
-----------|------|---------------
Mondays    | 9AM	| B44 1041
Tuesdays   | 9AM  | B54 5025
Thursdays	 | 12PM	| B02 1039
